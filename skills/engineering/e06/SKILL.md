# Nonlinear Structural Dynamics, ASCE 7-22 Inelastic Response Spectra & Seismic Base-Isolation Dampers (Folio E.06)

## 1. Governing Law & Tectonic Identity
- **Folio**: `E.06 · Seismic Structural Dynamics · CSI 13 48 00` (`REV 1.1`, Redated `2026-11-02`)
- **Governing Equation**: `M ü + C u̇ + F_s(u) = −M ü_g(t) · V_b = C_s W · μ_Δ = Δ_max / Δ_y`
- **Primary Verification Kernel**: `skills/engineering/e06/verify_e06.py`
- **Verification Benchmarks**: `Risk Category IV Hospital · E_loop = 4 Q_d (D_M − D_y)`
- **Primary Scite Anchor DOI**: https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784415788 (Scite Report: https://scite.ai/reports/10.1061/9780784415788)

## 2. Deterministic Verification & Falsification Rules
1. Compute secant isolator stiffness k_eff = Q_d / D_M + k_d and effective isolated period T_M = 2 * pi * sqrt(W / (g * k_eff)).
2. Evaluate bilinear hysteretic loop energy E_loop = 4 * Q_d * (D_M - D_y), equivalent viscous damping beta_eff = E_loop / (2 * pi * k_eff * D_M^2), and ASCE 7-22 damping factor B_M.
3. Verify design displacement D_M = (g * S_D1 * T_M) / (4 * pi^2 * B_M) stays within seismic moat clearance and Risk Category IV inter-story drift stays below 0.010 h_sx.

## 3. 4-Stage Physical & Mathematical Mechanism
- Stage 1 (Fixed-Base Resonance Amplification): An unisolated T_fixed = 0.65 s frame sits on the S_DS = 1.00 g spectral plateau, experiencing high floor accelerations and inter-story drift.
- Stage 2 (Lead-Rubber Period Lengthening, T_M = 2.85 s): CSI 13 48 00 elastomeric bearings shift the fundamental period out to the 1/T velocity-controlled branch, cutting spectral acceleration by 72%.
- Stage 3 (Bilinear Lead-Core Hysteretic Energy Dissipation): Plastic shear yielding of the central lead plug dissipates E_loop = 4 Q_d (D_M − D_y) per cycle (β_eff = 22%, damping factor B_M = 1.54).
- Stage 4 (ASCE 7-22 Risk Category IV Verification): Certifies isolator displacement D_M = 232 mm (< 400 mm moat limit), base shear C_s = 0.142 W, and superstructure drift ≤ 0.32%.

## 4. Reference Telemetry & Acceptance Bounds
- **Isolated Period & Damping**: `T_M = 2.85 s (B_M = 1.54)`
- **Isolator Displacement D_M**: `232 mm (Moat Limit 400 mm)`
- **Seismic Base Shear Ratio**: `V_b / W = 0.142 g (−74%)`
- **ASCE 7-22 Cat IV Verdict**: `IMMEDIATE OCCUPANCY PASS`

## 5. Frontier Discovery & Contemporary Research Context (2024–2026)
- **ASCE 7-22 Chapter 17 Multi-Period MCE_R Spectra & Bilinear Lead-Rubber Hospital Isolation**: Uniting Maurice Biot's 1932 response spectrum and William Robinson's Lead-Rubber Bearing (LRB), the ASCE/SEI 7-22 standard (DOI 10.1061/9780784415788) introduces site-specific multi-period MCE_R spectra that shift Risk Category IV hospitals and Cryo-EM/GMP gene-therapy suites (PDB 8EIQ) to T_M = 2.85 s, slashing seismic base shear by 74%.
